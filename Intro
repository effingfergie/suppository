## Eddie Jason Moffat
Eddie Jason Moffat (known to his friends as *The Haddie* ) beieved himself to be a talented technical communicator. He considered technical  writing to be his strongest field. 
Followed closely by presenting, <br> itself followed cloesly but teaching.
He enjoyed both the limitations of a finite set grammar rules he could, as ever, read from beginning to end and use as a reference book until it became second nature.
He enjoyed the act of looking something up. It is like prviding evidence to silence a nagging doubt in his head. It is scientific. He proves   or disproves his theory, hundreds of times a day.
That's what makes Google his favourite tool, followed by YouTube, where he can test his theories about the stu√¨dity of humanity.
#And his theories about the decine of civilization he fed by dipping occasionally into IG and TikTok.
But he also appreciated that this rigidity should only be seen as a framework on which to hang language, and that this langiuae should excude a depth of user empathy,   and an even greater depth of user pessimism.
