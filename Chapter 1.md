### Eddie Jason Moffat 
Eddie Jason Moffat thought himself something of a talented writer and editor. 


Not of literature. He hadn't written anything of any note since he discovered the drink. He was 15 when he basically stopped taking 
himself seriously as a writer. He daydreamed about it, and he even picked up a pen from time to time. 
Like with most thing, Eddie didn-t stick with a chapter long. Reading is fine. But writing? He preferred to BELIEVE he was a talented writer than to test the theory.

Only with the lure of payment up front, would he untether his literary talents. At first, he would vent his frustration with his hapless and empathetic colleagues, launching venomous verbal attacks at the timid and the
vulnerable in baffling English. This habit, later in life, when he moved to Spain and rediscovered the habit, is the basis of thi  s story. 
He had lost the habit when he discovered technical writing. Technical writing is technically writing. He could be creative in his writing, but in a very, very narrow bandwidth of creativity.
It remained, however, creativity.

And so, his creativity had found a channel. He was paid to write. And write, he did. Very little interaction with humans was required. Your day is spend reading and writing.
It is bliss.
Granted, the subject matter is monotonous, and the details are generally of very little interest to anyone other than a user of the software. The audience is small, but it is 
most certainly loyal. **They, too** are being paid, and they too have to do some reading *or some video watching, nowadays*

Since he has minimum contact with people at work since he changed jobs, he now again is focussing 
his creativity and love of words upon the eyes of disinterested users. Appreciation for his art had flagged over the decades. 
Generation Z has very little appreciation for technical writing. They were a fully audio-visual generation, with very little interest in the classics / either 
literary, cinematographic or historical.
